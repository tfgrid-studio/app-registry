# Submitting Your App to TFGrid Registry

This guide explains how to submit your application to the TFGrid App Registry for verification and inclusion.

## Overview

Getting your app verified means:
- âœ… Discoverable via `tfgrid-compose search`
- âœ… Listed in official registry
- âœ… Verified badge
- âœ… Increased visibility and trust

## Prerequisites

Before submitting:

1. **Working App**: Your app deploys successfully with `tfgrid-compose up ./your-app`
2. **Documentation**: Clear README with setup instructions
3. **App Manifest**: Valid `tfgrid-compose.yaml`
4. **Open Source**: Public repository with open source license
5. **No Secrets**: No hardcoded credentials or API keys

## Submission Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your App

Ensure your repository has:

```
your-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ tfgrid-compose.yaml       # Required: App manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                  # Required: Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE                    # Required: Open source license
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                # Recommended: Ignore secrets
â””â”€â”€ (app-specific files)
```

**Minimum `tfgrid-compose.yaml`:**
```yaml
name: your-app
version: 0.1.0
description: Brief description of your app

patterns:
  recommended: single-vm  # or gateway, k3s
  
config:
  # Your app configuration
```

### Step 2: Test Thoroughly

```bash
# Test local deployment
tfgrid-compose up ./your-app

# Verify all functionality
tfgrid-compose status
tfgrid-compose ssh

# Clean up
tfgrid-compose down
```

### Step 3: Fork Registry Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/app-registry
cd app-registry
git checkout -b add-your-app
```

### Step 4: Add Your App Entry

Edit `registry/verified/community.yaml` (create if doesn't exist):

```yaml
apps:
  verified:
    - name: your-app-name
      repo: github.com/your-username/your-app-repo
      author: your-username
      description: Clear one-line description of your app
      pattern: single-vm  # or gateway, k3s
      status: beta  # beta or production
      version: v0.1.0
      verified: false  # Will be set to true after review
      verified_date: null  # Will be set by team
      tags:
        - tag1
        - tag2
        - tag3
      requirements:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 4GB
        disk: 50GB
      links:
        docs: https://github.com/your-username/your-app-repo
        repo: https://github.com/your-username/your-app-repo
        demo: https://example.com  # optional
```

### Step 5: Create Pull Request

```bash
git add registry/verified/community.yaml
git commit -m "feat: add YOUR-APP to verified apps"
git push origin add-your-app
```

Create PR on GitHub with:
- **Title**: `Add [Your App Name] to verified apps`

  - What does your app do?
  - Why should users try it?
  - Any special requirements or notes?
