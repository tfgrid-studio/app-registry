# About Patterns vs Apps
#
# PATTERNS (built into tfgrid-compose):
# - single-vm: Single VM deployment pattern
# - gateway: Multi-VM gateway pattern with SSL
# - k3s: Kubernetes cluster pattern
#
# APPS (listed in this registry):
# - Actual applications that USE patterns
# - Have their own tfgrid-compose.yaml
# - Can be deployed with: tfgrid-compose up <app-name>
#
# Example: tfgrid-ai-agent is an APP that uses the single-vm PATTERN
