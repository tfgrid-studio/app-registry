    # Community Applications
    # Submitted by community members, reviewed and approved by tfgrid-studio team
    #
    # KEY DISTINCTION:
    # - Apps under "official" = Maintained by tfgrid-studio team (badge: "Official")
    # - Apps under "community" = Community submissions that passed review (badge: "Community")
    #
    # To submit your app:
    # 1. Follow guidelines in docs/app-guidelines.md
    # 2. Submit PR adding your app to this "community" section
    # 3. tfgrid-studio team reviews for quality, security, and functionality
    # 4. Once approved, app becomes discoverable via tfgrid-compose search
    # 5. You maintain your app, tfgrid-studio provides platform support
    
    # Example format for community apps:
    # - name: wordpress
    #   repo: github.com/username/tfgrid-wordpress
    #   author: username
    #   maintainer: username
    #   description: WordPress blog on ThreeFold Grid
    #   pattern: gateway
    #   status: beta
    #   version: v0.1.0

# Registry Metadata
# Note: App counts are computed dynamically by the parser, not stored here
metadata:
  version: 0.1.0
  last_updated: 2025-10-22
  schema_version: "1.0"
  registry_updated: true

# Note: tfgrid-ai-stack pattern is now built into tfgrid-compose
# The app registry entry points to the app wrapper that references the pattern

# Registry Structure Explanation
#
# PATTERNS (built into tfgrid-compose):
# - single-vm: Single VM deployment pattern
# - gateway: Multi-VM gateway pattern with SSL
# - k3s: Kubernetes cluster pattern
# - tfgrid-ai-stack: AI-powered development platform (multi-VM)
# These are NOT in this registry - they're part of tfgrid-compose
#
# APPS (listed in this registry):
# Two categories:
#
# 1. OFFICIAL APPS (apps.official):
#    - Maintained by tfgrid-studio team
#    - Production quality and full support
#    - Badge: "Official" in UI
#    - Example: tfgrid-ai-agent, tfgrid-gitea, tfgrid-ai-stack
#
# 2. COMMUNITY APPS (apps.community):
#    - Submitted and maintained by community members
#    - Reviewed and approved by tfgrid-studio team
#    - Badge: "Community" in UI
#    - Quality checked but supported by original author
#    - Example: tfgrid-wordpress (future)
#
# All apps:
# - Have their own tfgrid-compose.yaml
# - Use one of the patterns above
# - Can be deployed with: tfgrid-compose up <app-name>
#
# Terminology Note:
# We use "Community" instead of "Verified" because:
# - Clearer distinction: Official (by team) vs Community (by users)
# - Less confusing: "Verified" sounds like it could apply to official apps too
# - More welcoming: Celebrates community contributions
#
# Parser Implementation Note:
# The parser (e.g., in tfgrid-compose or registry-www) should compute these dynamically:
#   total_apps = len(apps.official) + len(apps.community)
#   official_apps = len(apps.official)
#   community_apps = len(apps.community)
# This ensures counts are always accurate without manual updates.
