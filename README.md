# TFGrid App Registry

Official registry of applications for TFGrid Compose - automatically validated and processed via CI/CD.

This registry catalogs official and community applications that can be deployed using `tfgrid-compose`. Applications listed here are discoverable via `tfgrid-compose search` and can be deployed with a simple command:

```bash
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

## Quick Start

### Using Official Apps

```bash
# List all available apps
tfgrid-compose search

# Get app details
tfgrid-compose info tfgrid-ai-agent

# Deploy official app
tfgrid-compose up tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### Using Unverified Community Apps

```bash
# Deploy from any GitHub repo
tfgrid-compose up username/repo-name

# Deploy from any git URL
tfgrid-compose up https://gitlab.com/org/app
```

## App Categories

### Official Apps (tfgrid-studio)

3. **Submit PR** adding your app to `apps.community` in `registry/apps.yaml`
4. **Automated validation** - GitHub Actions validates your app
5. **Review process** - Team reviews code, security, documentation
